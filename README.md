This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Swift's `JSONDecoder` where decoding malformed JSON doesn't trigger an error in the completion handler of a URLSession data task.  The issue arises when using the `Result` type for error handling.  The provided code reproduces the problem, and a solution is offered. The solution improves the error handling by explicitly checking for the type of error after decoding and providing more informative error messages.
